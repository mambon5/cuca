You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mambon5/cuca/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Things to do in life:
1) make an app to find out the best moment to drink beer
2) make the perfect 2D world map ever
3) start a sewing business and create by myself the best t-shirts and clothing pieces that mankiind has ever seen
4) Create an awesome online game where users can interact and have common fun.
5) Enhance the CART machine learning methods of classifying data using regression/classification trees. Allow fancy oblique splits.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
